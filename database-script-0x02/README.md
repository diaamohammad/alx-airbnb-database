# Task 3: Populate Database (DML)

This directory contains the SQL DML script to populate the Airbnb-like database, part of the ALX DataScape: Mastering Database Design project.

## Files
- **seed.sql**: SQL DML script to insert 10 records into each of the six tables (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message). The data respects all constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY) and uses UUIDs for primary keys.

## Usage
Run the `seed.sql` script after `schema.sql` (from Task 2) to populate the database with sample data.
